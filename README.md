A word cloud is an image made of words that together resemble a cloudy shape.
The size of a word shows how important it is e.g. how often it appears in a text â€” its frequency.

Here is a basic python script to create such a word cloud, I have used my favorite classic novel "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen. You can find other such texts at https://www.gutenberg.org/

This is the final project in the "Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate"'s course "Crash Course on Python", 
available on Coursera.
